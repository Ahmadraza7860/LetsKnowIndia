        <h2>Humayun's Tomb</h2><br>
        <h3>Humayun's tomb (Persian: Maqbara-i Humayun) is the tomb of the Mughal Emperor Humayun in Delhi, India.[1]
            The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum under her
            patronage[2][3][4][5][6] in 1558, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad,[7]
            Persian architects chosen by her.[8][9] It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent,[10] and is
            located in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, India, close to the Dina-panah Citadel, also known as Purana Qila (Old
            Fort), that Humayun found in 1538. It was also the first structure to use red sandstone at such a
            scale.[11][12] The tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993,[10] and since then has undergone
            extensive restoration work, which is complete.[13] Besides the main tomb enclosure of Humayun, several
            smaller monuments dot the pathway leading up to it, from the main entrance in the West, including one that
            even pre-dates the main tomb itself, by twenty years; it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niyazi, an Afghan
            noble in Sher Shah Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals, constructed in 1547 CE. <br> <br>

            The complex encompasses the main tomb of the Emperor Humayun, which houses the graves of Empress Bega Begum,
            Hamida Begum, and also Dara Shikoh, great-great-grandson of Humayun and son of the later Emperor Shah Jahan,
            as well as numerous other subsequent Mughals, including Emperor Jahandar Shah, Farrukhsiyar, Rafi Ul-Darjat,
            Rafi Ud-Daulat, Muhammad Kam Bakhsh and Alamgir II.[14][15] It represented a leap in Mughal architecture,
            and together with its accomplished Charbagh garden, typical of Persian gardens, but never seen before in
            India, it set a precedent for subsequent Mughal architecture. It is seen as a clear departure from the
            fairly modest mausoleum of his father, the first Mughal Emperor, Babur, called Bagh-e Babur (Gardens of
            Babur) in Kabul (Afghanistan). Though the latter was the first Emperor to start the tradition of being
            buried in a paradise garden.[16][17] Modelled on Gur-e Amir, the tomb of his ancestor and Asia's conqueror
            Timur in Samarkand, it created a precedent for future Mughal architecture of royal mausolea, which reached
            its zenith with the Taj Mahal, at Agra. <br> <br>

            The site was chosen on the banks of Yamuna river, due to its proximity to Nizamuddin Dargah, the mausoleum
            of the celebrated Sufi saint of Delhi, Nizamuddin Auliya, who was much revered by the rulers of Delhi, and
            whose residence, Chilla Nizamuddin Auliya lies just north-east of the tomb. In later Mughal history, the
            last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar took refuge here, during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, along with
            three princes, and was captured by Captain Hodson before being exiled to Rangoon.[9][21] At the time of the
            Slave Dynasty this land was under the 'KiloKheri Fort' which was capital of Sultan Qaiqabad, son of
            Nasiruddin (1268–1287).  <br> <br>

            The Tombs of Battashewala Complex lie in the buffer zone of the World Heritage Site of the Humayun Tomb
            Complex; the two complexes are separated by a small road but enclosed within their own separate compound
            wall </h3>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <img class="textimage" src="/delhi.html/humayuns tomb/3.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>After his death on 27 January 1556, Humayun's body was first buried in his palace in Purana Quila at
                Delhi. Thereafter it was taken to Sirhind, in Punjab by Khanjar Beg and, in 1558, it was seen by
                Humayun's son, the then Mughal Emperor, Akbar. Akbar subsequently visited the tomb in 1571, when it was
                about to be completed. <br> <br> <br>

                The tomb of Humayun was built by the orders of his first wife and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum
                (also known as Haji Begum). Construction began in 1565 and was completed in 1572; it cost 1.5 million
                rupees,[9] paid entirely by the Empress.[26] Bega Begum had been so grieved over her husband's death
                that she had thenceforth dedicated her life to a sole purpose: the construction of a memorial to him
                than would be the most magnificent mausoleum in the Empire, at a site near the Yamuna River in
                Delhi.[27] According to Ain-i-Akbari, a 16th-century detailed document written during the reign of
                Akbar, Bega Begum supervised the construction of the tomb after returning from Mecca and undertaking the
                Hajj pilgrimage. <br> <br> <br>

                According to Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni, one of the few contemporary historians to mention construction of
                the tomb, it was designed by the Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyas (also referred to as Mirak
                Ghiyathuddin), who was selected by the Empress and brought from Herat (northwest Afghanistan); he had
                previously designed several buildings in Herat, Bukhara (now Uzbekistan), and others elsewhere in
                India.[8] Ghiyas died before the structure was completed and it was completed by his son, Sayyed
                Muhammad ibn Mirak Ghiyathuddin. <br> <br> <br>

                An English merchant, William Finch, who visited the tomb in 1611, describes rich interior furnishing of
                the central chamber (in comparison to the sparse look today). He mentions the presence of rich carpets,
                as well as a shamiana, a small tent above the cenotaph, which was covered with a pure white sheet, and
                with copies of the Quran in front along with Humayun's sword, turban and shoes. <br> <br> <br>

                The fortunes of the once famous Charbagh (Four-gardens) made of four squares separated by four
                promenades, radiating from a central reflection pool. It spread over 13 hectares surrounding the
                monument, changed repeatedly over the years after its construction. The capital had already shifted to
                Agra in 1556, and the decline of the Mughals accelerated the decay of the monument and its features, as
                the expensive upkeep of the garden proved impossible. By the early 18th century, the once lush gardens
                were replaced by vegetable garden of people who had settled within the walled area. However, the capture
                of the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 together with the
                premises, and his subsequent sentencing to exile, along with execution of his three sons, meant that the
                monument's worst days lay ahead, as the British took over Delhi completely. In 1860, the Mughal design
                of the garden was replanted to a more English garden-style, with circular beds replacing the fours
                central water pools on the axial pathways and trees profusely planted in flowerbeds. This fault was
                corrected in the early 20th century, when on Viceroy Lord Curzon's orders the original gardens were
                restored in a major restoration project between 1903 and 1909, which also included lining the plaster
                channels with sandstone; a 1915 planting scheme added emphasis to the central and diagonal axis by
                lining it with trees, though some trees were also planted on the platform originally reserved for
                tents. <br> <br> <br>

                In 1882, the official curator of ancient monuments in India published his first report, which mentioned
                that the main garden was let out to various cultivators; amongst them till late were the royal
                descendants, who grew cabbage and tobacco in it. <br> <br> <br>

                In Ronaldshay's biography of Lord Curzon a letter is quoted from Lord Curzon to his wife in April 1905:
                "You remember Humayun's tomb? I had the garden restored, the water channels dug out and refilled and the
                whole place restored to its pristine beauty. I went to England last summer and, the eye of the master
                being away, the whole place has been allowed to revert. The garden has been let to a native and is now
                planted with turnips and the work of four years is thrown away! I shall drive out there, and woe betide
                the deputy commissioner whose apathy has been responsible." <br> <br> <br>

                During the Partition of India, in August 1947 the Purana Qila together with Humayun's Tomb, became major
                refugee camps for Muslims migrating to the newly founded Pakistan, and was later managed by the
                government of India. These camps stayed open for about five years, and caused considerable damage not
                only to the extensive gardens, but also to the water channels and the principal structures. The camps
                were raided many times by jathas which caused vandalism to occur during the early partition days in
                1947. Eventually, to avoid vandalism, the cenotaphs within the mausoleum were encased in brick. In the
                coming years, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) took on responsibility for the preservation of
                heritage monuments in India, and gradually the building and its gardens were restored. Until 1985, four
                unsuccessful attempts were made to reinstate the original water features. <br> <br> <br>

                An important phase in the restoration of the complex began around 1993, when the monument was declared a
                World Heritage Site. This brought new interest to its restoration, and a detailed research and
                excavation process began under the aegis of the Aga Khan Trust and the ASI. This culminated in 2003,
                when much of the complex and gardens were restored, with the historic fountains running once again after
                several centuries of disuse. The restoration has been a continuous process ever since, with subsequent
                phases addressing various aspects and monuments of the complex. <br> <br> <br>

            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <img class="subhashimage" src="/delhi.html/humayuns tomb/architecture.webp" alt="">
            <h3>Turkic and Mughal rule in the Indian subcontinent also introduced Central Asian and Persian styles of
                Islamic architecture in the region, and by the late 12th century early monuments in this style were
                appearing in and around Delhi, the capital of Delhi Sultanate. Starting with the Turkic Slave dynasty
                which built the Qutb Minar (1192) and its adjacent Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque (1193 CE). North India was
                successively ruled by foreign dynasties in the coming centuries, giving rise to the Indo-Islamic
                architecture. While the prevailing style of architecture was trabeate, employing pillars, beams and
                lintels, this brought in the arcuate style of construction, with its arches and beams, which flourished
                under Mughal patronage and by incorporating elements of Indian architecture, especially Rajasthani
                architecture including decorative corbel brackets, balconies, pendentive decorations and indeed kiosks
                or chhatris, to develop a distinct Mughal architecture style, which was to become a lasting legacy of
                the Mughal rule.[31] The combination of red sandstone and white marble was previously seen in Delhi
                Sultanate period tombs and mosques, most distinctively in the highly decorative Alai Darwaza gatehouse
                in the Qutub complex, Mehrauli, built in 1311, under the Khalji dynasty. <br> <br> <br>


                Humayun's Tomb Garden Enclosure Plan
                The high rubble built enclosure is entered through two lofty double-storeyed gateways on the west and
                south, 16 metres high with rooms on either side of the passage and small courtyards on the upper floors.
                The tomb, built of rubble masonry and red sandstone, uses white marble as a cladding material and also
                for the flooring, lattice screens (jaalis), door frames, eaves (chhajja), and the main dome. It stands
                on a vaulted terrace eight metres high and spread over 12,000m2. It is essentially square in design,
                though chamfered on the edges to appear octagonal, to prepare ground for the design of the interior
                structure. The plinth made with rubble core has fifty-six cells all around and houses over 100
                gravestones. The entire base structure is on a raised platform, a few steps high. <br> <br> <br>

                Inspired by Persian architecture; the tomb reaches a height of 47 metres (154 ft) and the plinth is 91
                metres (299 ft) wide, and was the first Indian building to use the Persian double dome on a high neck
                drum, and measures 42.5 metres (139 ft), and is topped by 6 metres (20 ft) high brass finial ending in a
                crescent, common in Timurid tombs. The double or 'double-layered' dome, has an outer layer that supports
                the white marble exterior, while the inner part gives shape to the cavernous interior volume. In a
                contrast to the pure white exterior dome, the rest of the building is made up of red sandstone, with
                white and black marble and yellow sandstone detailing, to relieve the monotony. <br> <br> <br>

                The symmetrical and simple design on the exterior is in sharp contrast with the complex interior floor
                plan, of the inner chambers, which is a square ninefold plan, where eight two-storied vaulted chambers
                radiate from the central, double-height domed chamber. It can be entered through an imposing entrance
                iwan (high arc) on the south, which is slightly recessed, while other sides are covered with intricate
                jaalis, stone latticework. Underneath this white dome in a domed chamber (hujra), lies the central
                octagonal sepulcher, the burial chamber containing a single cenotaph, that of the second Mughal Emperor,
                Humayun. The cenotaph is aligned on the north-south axis, as per Islamic tradition, wherein the head is
                placed to the north, while the face is turned sideways towards Mecca. The real burial chamber of the
                Emperor, however, lies in an underground chamber, exactly beneath the upper cenotaph, accessible through
                a separate passage outside the main structure, which remains mostly closed to visiting public. This
                burial technique along with pietra dura, a marble and even stone inlay ornamentation in numerous
                geometrical and arabesque patterns, seen all around the facade is an important legacy of Indo-Islamic
                architecture, and flourished in many later mausolea of the Mughal Empire, like the Taj Mahal, which also
                features twin cenotaphs and exquisite pietra dura craftsmanship. <br> <br> <br>

                The main chamber also carries the symbolic element, a mihrab design over the central marble lattice or
                jaali, facing Mecca in the West. Instead of the traditional Surah 24, An-Noor of Quran being inscribed
                on the mihrabs, this one is just an outline allowing light to enter directly into the chamber, from
                Qibla or the direction of Mecca, thus elevating the status of the Emperor above his rivals and closer to
                divinity</h3>

            <h2>Char Bagh</h2>
            <img class="textimage" src="/delhi.html/humayuns tomb/charbagh.webp" alt="">
            <h3>
                While the main tomb took over eight years to build, it was also placed in centre of a 30-acre (120,000
                m2) Charbagh, a Persian-style garden with a quadrilateral layout. It was the first of its kind in South
                Asia on such a scale.[23] The highly geometrical and enclosed Paradise garden is divided into four
                squares by paved walkways (khiyabans) and two bisecting central water channels, reflecting the four
                rivers that flow in jannat, the Islamic concept of paradise. Each of the four square is further divided
                into 8 smaller gardens with pathways, creating 32 miniature gardens in all (with the mausoleum in the
                centre), a design typical of later Mughal gardens. The central water channels appear to be disappearing
                beneath the tomb structure and reappearing on the other side in a straight line, suggesting a Quranic
                verse which talks of rivers flowing beneath the 'Garden of Paradise'. <br> <br> <br>

                Standing in the center at the place where the main axes intersect, the tomb is similar in form and
                position to a garden pavilion. But here it marks the place where the body of the deceased ruler rests.
                "The garden is about sovereignty, and the mausoleum is about dynasty. When the mausoleum is implanted in
                a garden, as it is at Humayun's tomb, sovereignty and dynasty are combined in a teleological statement
                that the king is king as he always has been and always will be." <br> <br> <br>

                The entire tomb and the garden is enclosed within high rubble walls on three sides. The fourth side was
                meant to be the river Yamuna, which has since shifted course away from the structure. The central
                walkways terminate at two gates: a main one in the southern wall, and a smaller one in the western wall.
                It has two double-storey entrances; the West gate is used now, while the South gate, which was used
                during Mughal era, is now closed. Aligned at the centre on the eastern wall lies a baradari, which is a
                building or room with twelve doors designed to allow the free draught of air through it. On the northern
                wall lies a hammam, a bath chamber.[36]</h3>

            <h2>Other monuments</h2>
            <img class="textimage" src="/delhi.html/humayuns tomb/other monuments.jpg" alt="">
            <h3> <b> <em> Tomb and mosque of Isa Khan:</em> </b> Several monuments dot the pathway leading up to the
                tomb enclosure from the
                main entrance in the West. Prominent among them is one that pre-dates the main tomb itself, by twenty
                years. Constructed in 1547 CE, it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niyazi, an Afghan noble in Sher Shah
                Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals. The octagonal tomb is positioned
                within an octagonal garden, which was built during his own lifetime and the reign of Islam Shah Suri,
                son of Sher Shah. It later served as a burial place for the entire family of Isa Khan. On the western
                side of the tomb lies a three-bay wide mosque, in red sandstone. The octagonal tomb bears a striking
                resemblance to other tombs of the Sur dynasty monuments in the Lodhi Gardens, in Delhi and demonstrates
                a marked progression in the development of the exquisite architectural style of the main tomb. Some of
                the architectural details present here were seen later in the main Humayun's tomb, though on a much
                grander scale, such as the tomb being placed in a walled garden enclosure. <br> <br> 

                <b> <em>Bu Halima's Tomb and Garden:</em> </b> When entering the complex from the West, visitor's
                first enter a garden
                complex, known as Bu Halima's Garden, though little is known about her, and since the tomb or the raised
                platform where it once stood is not at the centre, it appears to be a later <br> <br>

                <b> <em>Afsarwala Tomb and mosque: </em> </b> Standing southwest end of the complex, lies the Afsarwala
                tomb, dedicated to
                an unknown person. One of the marble graves inside the tomb is dated 1566-67 CE. The mosque itself can
                be dated to the same period judging from its siting, standing as it does adjacent to the tomb, rather
                than away from it. <br>  <br>

                <b> <em> Arab Serai: </em> </b> Literally meaning the sarai (resthouse) for the horses, the structure
                stands adjacent to the
                Afsarwala mosque and was built by Bega Begum[39] around 1560-1561 CE, ostensibly built for the craftsmen
                who came for the construction work. It could accommodate 300 Arabas. (in Persian ارابه means:Cart or
                Gari (vehicle)). <br> <br>

                <b> <em> Nila Gumbad: </em> </b> Standing outside the boundary of the complex is the tomb known as Nila
                Burj (now known as
                Nila Gumbad) or 'Blue Dome', so called because it carries striking blue glazed tiles. It was built by
                Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana, son of Bairam Khan also a courtier in Mughal Emperor, Akbar's court, for his
                servant Miyan Fahim. Fahim, who not only grew up with his son, but later also died alongside one of
                Rahim's own sons, Feroze Khan, while fighting against the rebellion of Mughal general Mahabat Khan in
                1625–26, during the reign of Jahangir.[40] This structure is known for its unique architecture, as it is
                octagonal on the outside while square within; its ceiling is decorated with painted and incised plaster,
                it has a high neck dome and shows a conspicuous absence of a double dome feature, common to tombs of the
                period. <br>   <br>

                <b> <em> Chillah Nizamuddin Aulia: </em> </b> Believed to be the residence of patron saint of Delhi,
                Nizamuddin Auliya (d.
                1325), is located just outside the main complex, near the northeastern corner of the principal mausoleum
                and is an example of Tughlaq period architecture.

                Yet further away from the tomb complex, lie Mughal-period monuments, Bada Bateshewala Mahal, the tomb of
                Muzaffar Husain Mirza, the grand nephew of Humayun, built 1603–04 on platform with five arches on each
                side, has its interior walls decorated with incised and painted plaster; the Chote Bateshewala Mahal
                once an arcaded octagonal building with a domed ceiling and stone jaalis. Both these monument now lie
                inside a commercial area facing the complex's parking lot.[41] Another period structure is Barapula, a
                bridge with 12 piers and 11 arched openings, built in 1621 by Mihr Banu Agha, the chief eunuch of
                Jahangir's court <br>  <br>

                <b> <em>Barber's Tomb: </em> </b> Towards the south-east corner, within the Char Bagh, lies a tomb known
                as Nai-ka-Gumbad,
                or Barber's Tomb, belonging to royal barber, it is datable to 1590-91 CE, through an inscription found
                inside. Its proximity to the main tomb and the fact that it is the only other structure within the main
                tomb complex suggests its importance, however, there are no inscriptions suggesting as to who is
                interred therein, the name Barbers tomb is the local name of the structure, hence still in use.[32]

                The tomb stands on a raised platform, reached by seven steps from the south, it has a square plan and
                consists of a single compartment covered with a double-dome. Inside lie two graves each inscribed with
                verses from the Quran. Also, one of the graves is inscribed with figure 999 which may stand for the
                Hijra year 1590–91. However, in an 1820 watercolour now at British Library, the Persian caption beneath
                the structure reads, Maqbarah-i-Kokah i.e. "Tomb of Kaka", and Kokah or Kaka in Persian stand for
                foster-brother (mirak brother), Mirak (a Persian title as sir) though the identity of the person remains
                unknown, and it might be (incorrectly) referring to another nearby monument in the Chausath Khamba
                complex, the tomb of Ataga Khan, the foster brother of Humayun, which lies in Nizamuddin West area and
                not to the east of the Humayun's tomb. <br> <br>

            <h2>Restoration</h2>
            <img class="subhashimage" src="/delhi.html/humayuns tomb/restoration.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Before the restoration work was undertaken, vandalism and illegal encroachments were rampant at the site
                of the tomb, presenting a serious danger to the preservation of this invaluable treasure. At the main
                entrance of Humayun's Tomb, dingy stalls had been put up under a very corrupt system of municipal
                patronage known as tehbazari, and all sorts of heavy vehicles were allowed to be parked illegally in
                these open spaces. On the Nila Gumbad side was a huge citadel of India's vote bank politics – thousands
                of "slum dwellers" were kept by an influential section of the political leadership to serve as "bonded
                voters" during elections. The environment of the dargah of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya had also been
                ruthlessly degraded and the holy tank had become a messy cesspool. <br>

                Restoration work by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), in collaboration with Archaeological Survey
                of India (ASI), began around 1999 after research work, which started in 1997, and was completed in March
                2003. Around 12 hectares of lawns were replanted, and over 2500 trees and plants, including mango,
                lemon, neem, hibiscus and jasmine cuttings, were planted in the gardens. Installation of a new water
                circulation system for the walkway channels was also undertaken. To ensure that water flowed naturally
                through the channels and pools on the 12-hectare (30 acre) site without the aid of hydraulic systems,
                the water channels were re-laid to an exacting grade of one centimetre every 40 metres (1:4000 slope).
                This eventually enabled water to flow through the watercourses in the gardens, and dormant fountains to
                start functioning once again. Other tasks in this mammoth restoration project included setting up a
                rainwater harvesting system using 128 ground water recharge pits, and desilting and revitalising old
                wells that were discovered during the restoration work.[46][47] This was first a privately funded
                collaborative effort under the aegis of the National Cultural Fund (NCF) by the ASI. Funding included a
                sum of $650,000 from the Aga Khan Trust for Culture of His Highness the Aga Khan, with help from the
                Oberoi Hotels Group.[48][49][50][51] In addition, AKTC is conducting a more significant restoration at
                Babur's tomb, the resting place of Humayun's father in Kabul. <br>

                After the restoration work, the conditions in and around this complex underwent a sea-change. All the
                stalls and other intrusions were removed and the monuments and green spaces restored. Elegant gardens
                now surround the monuments, adding to their dignity and grace. When illuminated at night, the monument
                looks truly magnificent. <br>

                In 2009, as a part of the ongoing restoration work, the ASI and AKTC, after months of manual work using
                hand-tools, removed from the roof a thick layer of cement concrete that had been exerting pressure of
                about 1,102 tons on the structure. The cement concrete was originally laid in the 1920s to prevent water
                seepage, and led to a blockage in water passages. Subsequently, each time there was leakage, a fresh
                layer of cement was added, leading to an accumulated thickness of about 40 cm; this has now been
                replaced with a traditional lime-based roof layer. In the next phase, similar treatment was given to the
                tomb's first chabutra (plinth), which was originally paved with large blocks of quartzite stone, some
                weighing over a 1,000 kg. In the 1940s, an uneven settlement in the lower plinth had been corrected by
                covering it with a layer of concrete, adding to the disfigurement of the original Mughal flooring, which
                matched with that at the West Gate.

            <h3>Ill thought out construction plans like The Delhi Government's plans in 2006–2007 to build a new tunnel
                to connect East Delhi to Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi in South Delhi, and to widen the roads near the
                tomb for the 2010 Commonwealth Games to connect National Highway-24 with Lodhi Road, also posed a
                serious threat to the monument. Urban planners feared that the historic monument would not have been
                able to withstand the vibrations ensuing from the construction work in such close proximity. Finally,
                the Archaeological Survey of India was able to halt the plans.[54][55]

                On 30 May 2014, the finial of the tomb was knocked off the dome by a heavy storm which struck the
                city.[56] On 19 April 2016, India's Union Culture Minister Dr. Mahesh Sharma unveiled the restored
                finial of the monument.[57] The original finial will be conserved.
